# Discord bot Spammy
I had interest in creating a discord bot. So here I am with Spammy! A basic bot that can spam users ;p

I enjoyed making this project. It showed me how discord bots work.

## Features
My discord bot Spammy has the following features:
- **/hello-bot**: the bot sends hello to you
- **/quote**: the bot sends a random quote
- **/react**: the bot reacts to your message with a random emoji
- **/dm-me**: the bot dm's you
- **/spam-dm**: the bot spams the user you specify. The user needs to be in your server.
- **/stop-spam-dm**: the bot stops spamming the user

## Technologies Used
This discord bot was made in python with the discord.py library.

## How to Run the Project
You can run this project with the following steps:

1. Download the files.
2. Run main.py with the following command: ```python main.py```
3. Enjoy!

**Be sure that you have Python and the discord.py library installed**
